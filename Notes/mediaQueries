Desktop vs Tablet vs phone

Need to consider different form factors and design separately for each device
- detect size of the screen
- desktop: >= 1024 px
- tablet - 481 to 1023 px
- phone: less than 480px

Can change colors, etc depending on layout

How to find size of screen?
-media query

if screen <= 480px:
    .navbtn color yellow
if > 480px
    .navbtn color blue
if >= 1024
    .navbtn color red

Flexible units
- usually use px for padding because we want the same amouont regardless of screen size
- can use % to set an element to take a certain amount of available width, which is determined by screen size
- em and rem - em is a multiplier of element's parent

Grid System
- imagine page is split into even columns and rows
- define a column as % of screen width

Give different classes depending on screen size
-phone: .small-1column
-tablet: .medium-2column
-desktop: .large-4column

screen <=480px
    define small-1column width 100%
screen > 480px
    define medium-2column 50%
screen >= 1024px
    define large-4column 25%
